    <h2>About Pizza Hotline</h2>
    <div class="textbox">
        <p>
            Like many great success stories, the tale of Pizza Hotline and Café 22 stems from humble beginnings. <br />What started with one small pizza restaurant in Winnipeg back in 1988 has grown steadily into a network of market-dominating franchise operations, with ten locations in Winnipeg, one each in Steinbach, Winkler, Brandon, and another in Stonewall.

            By adapting to change while staying true to our mission, we’ve developed a system for success based on nearly 20 years of industry experience. We’ve proven we’re no flash in the pan. And we’re growing again. We’ve developed an aggressive expansion plan to increase our presence across North America and now we need just the right people to join our family of franchisees.

            We offer two franchise package options – Pizza Hotline take-out and delivery locations, and Café 22 dine-in restaurants, which feature an expanded Pizza Hotline menu served up in a funky yet unpretentious atmosphere.

            Is there a Pizza Hotline or Café 22 near you? If not… what are you waiting for?
